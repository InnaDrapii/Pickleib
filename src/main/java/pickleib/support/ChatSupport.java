If user wishes to acquire elements from page objects, they should refer to the ElementAcquisition class within pickleib.element package. ElementAcquisition class has a subclass called PageObjectModel, which containts element acquisition methods such as elementFromPage(), or elementFromComponent(). These methods return a WebElement that can then be used to interact with the page page. Interaction Methods of Pickleib can be found in WebUtilities class on Pickleib, which contains interaction utilities such as clickElement(), fill() and verifyElementState(). The element that was acquired from the element acquisition methods then can be sent into the interaction methods, which will the perform the interaction " +
                            "Pickleib's element acquisition methods allow testers to easily acquire web elements from page objects, and the interaction methods allow them to interact with those elements without having to write additional code for each element. " +

This feature allows testers to focus on implementing web elements & page objects, so that they do not have to write interaction methods such as click, fill or verify presence, nor do they have to implement new cucumber steps for each new web element. Instead, they implement web elements, then use the utility methods to acquire and interact with the web elements. This saves the tester a lot of time while implementing test automations, as well as make test automation possible for people who do not have a lot of programming experience." +
